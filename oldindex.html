            <span class="break"> CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
            with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up 
            late with his notebook and equations, 
            venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </span>
            <span class="break">
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should
              have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the
              universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of
              cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
              faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </span>
            <span class="break">
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
              look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
              wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
            </span>
            <span class="break">
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of
              the page and drew a double box around it.
            </span>
            <span class="break">
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
              reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
            </span>
            <span class="break">
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver
              of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
              Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a
              universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a
              trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
              Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </span>
            <span class="break">
              inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
              Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
            </span>
          <div class="big">AS Big As It Gets</div>
            <span class="break">
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies
              forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new
              insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first
              direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
          </span>
          <span class="break">
            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
          </span>
          <span class="break">
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
            space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
          </span>
          <span class="break">  
            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging
            of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the
            Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how
                the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong>  is just under 14 billion years old.
                From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a
                sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery.
                Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.
            </div>
            <div class="cosmos">
                <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other,
                and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold
                to mix into an even temperature.

            <div class="telescope">
              <strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong>  At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a
              mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam,
              you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.

            <strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>  Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a
            similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature.
            Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction,
            you might want to look for another explanation.
            </div>
           <div class="time">
            <strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to

            from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.
           </div>
          <div class="problem">
           <strong>INFLATION</strong>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that,
           less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang,
           the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
           ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually
           grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.

       ` <div class="flactuation">
          <strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized
          light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the
          early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

       ` <div class="expansion">
        <strong>EXPANSION</strong>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding
        faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands.
        That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.

          Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
        </span>
        <span class="break"> 
          Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had
          not expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
         </span>
         <span class="break">
          “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”

         <span class="break">
          The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
          worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email
          for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered
          drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with
          Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
          that night in 1979), in his office last week.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
         “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as

          Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr.
          Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.

         Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered <br>anything.
         </span>
         <span class="break">
          “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not
          think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
         </span>
         <span class="break">
          Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
          hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of <br>spoiling a vacation,” he said.
         </span>
         <span class="break">
            By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors
            that inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists
            responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
         </span>
         <span class="break">
            Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it
            will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
         </span>
         <span class="break">
          John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and
          head of a competing project called the South Pole
          Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed.
          “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
         </span> 
         <span class="break">
          Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that
          posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of
          genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would
          eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about inflation.
          </span>
          <span class="break">
          Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
          noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based
          on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
          </span>
          <span class="break">
            “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
          </span>
          <span class="break">
          Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year.

            <strong>Spirals in the Sky</strong><br>
            Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic
            microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias
            and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the <br>Nobel Prize.
          </span>
          <span class="break">
            Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of
            these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has
            operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes
            at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal
            observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the
            University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the
            California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of  Stanford.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
         “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said.
         He has been there 23 times, he said, <br>wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.
        </span>

         <span class="break">
          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation
          was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
          preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
         </span>
         <span class="break">
          This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation.
          Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as
          they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves,
          theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small
          differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2,
          is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
         </span>
         <span class="break">
          “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
          The strength of the signal surprised the researchers,
          and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard
          supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough

          Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
          gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak
          nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are
          simply different manifestations of a single unified force
          that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a
          fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of
          gods or brothers falling out with each other.
          The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          That was where Dr. Guth came in.
        </span>
        <span class="break">  
          Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
          until it is disturbed, at which
          point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a
          unified state too long. In that case, space itself
          would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
        </span>  
        <span class="break">
          Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent
          energy would act as a kind of antigravity,
          and the universe would blow itself up.
          Since it was space itself supplying the
          repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          What would become our observable universe mushroomed
          in size at least a trillion trillionfold —
          from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy
          to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into
          ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic
          history was still ahead, resulting in today’s
          observable universe, a patch of sky
          and stars billions of light-years across.
          “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a
          free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or
          so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
          suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal.
          Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
          homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up,
          spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund,
          but do not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          We might never know what happened before inflation,
          at the very beginning, because inflation erases
          everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of
          the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.
        </span>
        <span class="break">
          “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
          Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was
          not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
